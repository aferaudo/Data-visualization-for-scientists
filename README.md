This repository contains scripts and data used to plot the graphs included in the exam report


## Creating report data visualizations

### Python
The script [data_viz.py](https://github.com/aferaudo/Data-visualization-for-scientists/blob/main/code/Python/data_viz.py) generates Figure 1 and Figure 4.

The folder `code/Python/data` contains the datasets used to geerate them.

The following commands allows to run the `data_viz.py`

```bash
cd code/Python
python data_viz.py
```

The script generates a static version of the graphs in the directory [graphs](https://github.com/aferaudo/Data-visualization-for-scientists/tree/main/graphs).


### Tableau

Open the file [Cartella2.twb](https://github.com/aferaudo/Data-visualization-for-scientists/blob/main/code/tableau/Cartella2.twb) to interact and create Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Datasets used for these visualizations are in the folder `code/tableau`
